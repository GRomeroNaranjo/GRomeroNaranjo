## About Me

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @GRomeroNaranjo. I code in python, and I am passionate towards AI, Math, and Computer Science. I love learning how different algorithms work, and then aim to replicate them. Iâ€™m interested in Machine Learning and Deep Learning. Currently still expanding my knowledge for these fields.

## My Projects

While I am currently a beginner, I am working on many interesting, intricate, and complex projects. Recently, I have been developing, and implementing some Deep Learning algorithms from scratch, in order to fully understand what goes on in the background. I am also using tensorflow and sklearn, to forecast, classify, and segregate many types of data. These types of projects are allowing me to expand my knowledge within this field. In the future I plan to start implementing and creating some multi-task learning models.
