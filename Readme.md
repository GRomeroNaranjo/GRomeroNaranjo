# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 13-year-old developer passionate about deep learning. I'm currently working on various deep learning projects and constantly learning new things.

## About Me

- ðŸ§  I love deep learning and artificial intelligence.
- ðŸ’» I'm working on multiple deep learning projects.
- ðŸ“š I'm always eager to learn and improve my skills.

## Projects

### TrendX - Stock Prediction Model
TrendX is a sophisticated stock prediction model. The goal is to accurately predict stock market trends using advanced machine learning techniques. 
- **Technologies used**: Python, TensorFlow, Keras
- **Features**:
  - Historical data analysis
  - Feature engineering for better predictions
  - Implementation of LSTM networks for time-series forecasting
  - Backtesting strategies to evaluate model performance
- **Current status**: Improving model accuracy by integrating a decoder transformer architecture.

### Aurora - Language Model
Aurora is a language model based around the GPT-2 architecture. It aims to generate human-like text.
- **Technologies used**: Python, PyTorch
- **Features**:
  - Text generation
  - Custom dataset training
- **Current status**: Training the model with various datasets to enhance its text generation capabilities.

### Self-Walking Robot
The self-walking robot project involves designing and building a robot capable of autonomous walking and going to a specified point. Initially, the robot moves using wheels, but the goal is to develop a more advanced walking mechanism. This project includes simulation and real-world testing to refine the robot's navigation and obstacle avoidance capabilities. The robot uses a combination of algorithms to move independently.
