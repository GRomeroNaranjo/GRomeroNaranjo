## About Me

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @GRomeroNaranjo. I am 13 years old, and I code in python, and I am passionate towards Deep Learning, Math, and generally computer science. I am currently working on many intricate projects, including a Language Model for an AI research company, a stock prediction deep learning program, and a medical advisor program empowered by artificial intelligence. 

## What I am working on

I am currently working at an AI research company called Sociloc, as one of the co-founders, I am leading the development of many AI technologies. TrendX is currently under prototyping, while I am leading the LLM creation (Aurora), and the medical advisor creation (Zylo). I have experience with deep learning, I know the mathematics within many algorithms (Such as CNN, RNN, LSTM, Transformers, FNN, GAN, etc.), and I also have a lot of creativity towards new implementations of these algorithms. I am also currently working on some research for an algorithm I call CSN. It implements a way where two algorithms can teach each other, and optimize each other to develop more diverse parameters.
