Hey, I’m Guillem Romero Naranjo. I’m 14 and kind of obsessed with math and machine learning. Most of my time goes into exploring the more theoretical side of things—real analysis, graph theory, that sort of stuff—but I’m also deep into the applied side, especially when it comes to deep learning and AI research. Right now, I’m playing around with transformer architectures, not just in the usual NLP way, but also for time series forecasting, which has been pretty fascinating.

I’ve also been looking at how reinforcement learning can be used to improve large language models, and digging into the practical side of graph neural networks. On the more foundational level, I’ve started working through combinatorics, abstract algebra, and Bayesian probability—mainly to support personal research projects and experiments.

Outside of the purely academic stuff, I’m building something called Sociloc, which is focused on deploying AI research into actual products. It’s still early, but the idea is to bridge the gap between cool theory and real-world impact.

Always open to collaborate, share ideas, or jump into a project. If it’s interesting and there's something to learn, I’m probably in.
