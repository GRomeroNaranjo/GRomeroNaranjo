- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @GRomeroNaranjo. I code in python, and I am passionate towards AI, Math, and Computer Science. I love learning how different algorithms work, and then aim to replicate them.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Machine Learning and Deep Learning. Currently still expanding my knowledge for these fields.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about multi-task learning, and working on some cool models.
